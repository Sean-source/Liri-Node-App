# Liri-Node-App

The goal of this project was to create a LIRI Bot. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. 
Here are the commands the application takes in: 

concert-this
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says


This application utilizes axios, spotify api, OMDb API, Bands api, and moment.js.
